    "version": "17.0.1.0.0",
    "summary": "Adds an incrementing.sequence.mixin model to inherit from.",
    "description": """
    Adds an incrementing.sequence.mixin model to inherit from. This model adds a
    sequence field to the models that inherit from it, including the logic to set it to
    the highest current sequence number + 1 by default and to leave it otherwise
    changeable by the user (i.e. with a drag and drop via the handle).
    
    Specify the _sequence_group attribute on the model to indicate which field to use
    to determine if records belong to the same group. For example, if one were to use
    this on sale.order.line, they could specify "order_id" as the _sequence_group such
    that newly created lines take on the highest sequence number of all lines on the
    same sales order.
