====================================
Odoo Medical Prescription Sale Stock
====================================

* This module adds dispense logic to prescription sale orders and integrates with the process of stock and inventory
  management found in the Odoo Inventory Management (stock) app. This also extends to OTC orders as well.

* Prescription order lines in the Medical panel will be highlighted red in the
  respective tree views if they cannot be dispensed due to lack of stock inventory available.

* The prescription order lines will also be red if there is a Date Stop Treatment defined and the current date is
  greater than the stop date.

Usage
=====

#. Go to Settings -> Groups -> Manage Push and Pull inventory flows
#. Add the desired users to this group
#. Users added to the group should then be able to go to Inventory -> Configuration ->
Warehouse Management -> Warehouses
#. When they create or edit a warehouse, they will be able to select if the warehouse
is a pharmacy and supply a prescription route and OTC route in the "Pharmacy" tab
#. Go to Medical -> Medicine -> Prescription Orders and select a prescription
to view the order lines
