Partner Multi Relation Hierarchy
================================

This module extends the concept of relations between partners with the concept
of an hierarchy.

For istance a company belonging to a larger concern would have the concern
'above' it.

Or a person might belong to a local organisation, that in turn might belong
to a provincial organisation, which might belong to a nation organisation.

It will not be excluded that a partner might be connected to several
hierarchies.

The hierarchical 'chains' will be made visible on the partner.
