Goal
====
This is an example Odoo module. It adds functionality to handle fictional Veterinary Clinic. It is not particularly useful, but it gives the idea of bare minimum required to create a new module.


Description
===========
Module adds an "animals" table and links it to owners (res.partner). Animals are shown inside Clients form, but can also be viewed inside dedicated "Animals" menu.

In the script folder there is a simplified client import script

Reports folder contains Sale Order report that will be used instead of standard report
